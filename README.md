Minesweeper
===========

Minesweeper clone made for a Computer Science Assignment.

It was made using Java and it took one week to complete.

It is minecraft themed which is why the "mines" are creepers, the "flags" are signposts and the blocks that are uncovered use a grass texture from a minecraft papercraft net.

Instructions:
===============
1. Compile the source files
2. Run the program.
