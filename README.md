# Minesweeper

Minesweeper clone made for a Computer Science Assignment.

It was made using Java and it took one week to complete.

It is minecraft themed which is why the "mines" are creepers, the "flags" are
signposts and the blocks that are uncovered use a grass texture
from a minecraft papercraft net.
